# Plant_Maintenance
The Plant Maintenance system is the problem of developing a maintenance schedule for electrical power units. The problem is to schedule the maintenance of the units in such a way that the total capacity of all units is maximised 

So, the first page will require u to load a file, so the file that u will have to load is the text file named ”test” in the same folder and then press solve
 
So, a program takes an input as an instance of the problem specified in a text file and applies a genetic algorithm to create a maintenance schedule that maximises the total capacity of all units.
